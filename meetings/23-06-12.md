# G2C data
* What is the A and B in the electrode name, does it matter? (Should not matter because otherwise we have more than 60 electrodes)
* But than I only have 59 unique electrodes?
* What are the differences across the samples with the same age and region?

# The parameter space exploration issue
* We need so many runs to really explore the parameter space deeply enough as to generate reasonable results
* We can also look at some first results, such it becomes clearer why we would need to do that
* Currently speed is likely below that of MATLAB
* Should I implement the GNMs in C, alternatively faster cluster

# Distance measurements
* Could we integrate fiber length? Or how significant would the difference to Euclidean distance be?

# Network rules
* Why would you always limit wiring rules to only two nodes?

# Optimization
* Veronoi tesselation?
* Why not others like simulated annealing?
