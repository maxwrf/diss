# Past Week
* Implemented coin toss
* Figured out why we there were self connecting edges
* Prepared the other 12 models

# Next week
* Test scripts: Simply run the model over and over!
* Hippocampus against cortex paper and data to use on the model
    *  15 minute to short for sub-sampling
    *  There is 2 hour recording repo
* Eg. take three hippocampus and cortex recordings and compare them, do they cluster together

# Questions
* Any ideas for test scripts

# Other
* Izhikevich mode (Synthetic data) https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.htm
    * How good STTC?
    * How good model?
    * get 99 simulated network, does the real one looks different?
    * Energy measurement is maybe a weakness in the paper
    * Alternatively have a space and then display the distance...
