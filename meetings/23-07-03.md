## Paper: Generative models of rich clubs in Hebbian networks
* Well they argue that they need to use the Hebbian networks to show the development of rich clubs on cellular level
* But I thought that MEAs are made for this exact reason

## Locations in the MEAs
* So is it correct that one starts top left (which one)
* Other one (which one starts) top right
* Also why do some start with e.g. 200mm so 1x the distance and others start from zero


## Maccione 64 by 64 dataset
```bash
h5dump -r "/Users/maxwuerfek/code/diss/data/Maccione2014/Maccione2014_P8_m2r1_bursts_filtered.h5"
````
* "Ch14.65"
* How is 65 possible?

## Implemented the Weight model
* At the moment we are not quicker
* Can I find a way for better derivative taking
    * Complex Step approximation
