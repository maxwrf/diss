# Questions  
- What is this random component in the brain toolbox in matlab? Should we not retrieve the max probability element? Why does it give different results?
- No seed network: that mean we do use D from the plate and A all elements zero?
- Can we talk through the data structure?
- Any raw spike data, i.e. not matlab?
- What is the package language for the upcoming project

# Next week
- Random results: Implement the biased coin toss (same seed same results)
- Add the other twelve models
- Can I come up with some reasonable test scripts
- What about the loops? 
    -  Can I check how Alex want about them?
- Read and take the data from the hippocampus against cortex paper

# Other
- Setup meeting to see recoding
    - Physiology building 
- Novel data potential to be analyzed
    - Optogentics data (Genotypes reverted by light)
    - Standard electrodes (compared to high density), where spike sorting is a more intense problem
- Data from Alex paper, quite unorganized at the moment
    - Hz => min firing rate
    - Lag => time window
