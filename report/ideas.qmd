# Brain Formation and structure
## Parsimonious principles
These reach back very far to as Ramon y Cajal (1899).

### Network wiring cost
There is overvelwheling evidence in favor of this hypothesis [@bullmore_economy_2012]:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cost of building and maintaining axonal connections and speed of transmission increase in wiring volume which is proportional to length (D)
    \item White matter grows faster than grey-matter as function of brain size, driven by increase in axonal diameter and number synapses per neuron
    \item Fraction of grey matter neurons that send myelinated axons into white matter slowly reduces with brain size
    \item The probability distribution of connection distances is skewed towards short distances that will be relatively parsimonious in wiring cost
\end{itemize}
Factors which potentially explain the deviations from this simple wiring principle [@bullmore_economy_2012]:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Volume exclusions = Due to the limited size of the brain, axonal projections must perturbate from the straight line connection
    \item Functional properties = Example: Monosynaptic vs. Polysynaptic nerves, when you need low latency you would build a high cost long axonal connection
\end{itemize}

### Network running cost
Not part of Cajal's initial principal's, but metabolic cost of running the brain has become an increasingly important principle for network formation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bigger brains are metabolically more expensive, with a rate increasing faster than overall body oxygen increase as function of weight
    \item The cost attributable to maintenance of electrochemical gradients across membranes
    \item Cost increases in overall neuronal membrane size as well as axonal length and diameter, this controlling length also limits energy requirements
    \item Limitation: Networks often functionally configured to be less expensive than possible within the anatomical constraints (network formation), e.g., through sparse coding
\end{itemize}

# Generative network models
These models were first developed and applied to connectome data by @betzel_generative_2016.

## Evaluation
$$
E = max(KS_{k}, KS_{c}, KS_{b}, KS_{e})
$$
to quantify the difference between the synthetic and observed data using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.
The corresponding statistic is computed for every vertex, and then the distributions are compared.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $KS_{K}$ Nodal degree = Number of edges that are incident to a vertex
    \item $KS_{C}$ Clustering (coefficient) = Measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together, proportion of possible connections realized among the neighbors of a vertex (Where the neighbor of a vertex are all the other connected vertices)
    \item $KS_{b}$ Betweenness centrality = Measures the centrality of a vertex by investigating the number of shortest paths that pass through the vertex (For every pair of vertices there exists a shortest path between them minimizing either the number of edges or the summed weights of the edges)
    \item $KS_{e}$ Edge length = Sum off al the edge length that are incident to a vertex 
\end{itemize}

## Optimization

## Rules
### Geometric
\begin{itemize}
    \item Promotion of low cost connections is promoted, but forming only the shortest connections, produces lack of long distance connections, which increases path length, and reduces efficiency
    \item Problems in reproducing clustering and edge length distributions simultaneously ($KS_{c}, KS_{e}$), this is because strong distance penalty required to make high clustering but then lacking long distance connections 
\end{itemize}
### Degree
### Clustering
### Homophilic
#### Matching index
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normalized measure of the overlap in two vertexes neighborhoods
    \item that eta and gamma seem to trade offer with each other, such that a connectome is either shaped by geometry or non-geometric constraints
\end{itemize}

# Graphs
## Rich clubs
\begin{itemize}
    \item Measure the extent by which well connected nodes are connected to each other
    \item Networks of high rich-club coefficients have many connections between nodes of high degree
\end{itemize}

# Random dictionary
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gray matter = Composed of the neurons (appears darker due ot higher levels of melanin)
    \item White matter = Mainly made up of myelinated axons also called tracts (light appearance through the lipid content of myelin)
    \item Monosynaptic reflex = There is only one synapse between the afferent nerve and the efferent nerve (slow latency)
    \item Polysnaptic reflex = There are more than one synapse between the nerves, such that there is higher latency
    \item Sparse coding = Neural coding that represents the information by activation of small subset of the available neurons
\end{itemize}
