# Generative network models
These models were first developed and applied to connectome data by @betzel_generative_2016.

## Evaluation
$$
E = max(KS_{k}, KS_{c}, KS_{b}, KS_{e})
$$
to quantify the difference between the synthetic and observed data using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.
The corresponding statistic is computed for every vertex, and then the distributions are compared.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $KS_{K}$ Nodal degree = Number of edges that are incident to a vertex
    \item $KS_{C}$ Clustering (coefficient) = Measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together, proportion of possible connections realized among the neighbors of a vertex (Where the neighbor of a vertex are all the other connected vertices)
    \item $KS_{b}$ Betweenness centrality = Measures the centrality of a vertex by investigating the number of shortest paths that pass through the vertex (For every pair of vertices there exists a shortest path between them minimizing either the number of edges or the summed weights of the edges)
    \item $KS_{e}$ Edge length = Sum off al the edge length that are incident to a vertex 
\end{itemize}

## Optimization

## Rules
### Geometric
\begin{itemize}
    \item Promotion of low cost connections is promoted, but forming only the shortest connections, produces lack of long distance connections, which increases path length, and reduces efficiency
    \item Problems in reproducing clustering and edge length distributions simultaneously ($KS_{c}, KS_{e}$), this is because strong distance penalty required to make high clustering but then lacking long distance connections 
\end{itemize}
### Degree
### Clustering
### Homophilic
#### Matching index
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normalized measure of the overlap in two vertexes neighborhoods
    \item that eta and gamma seem to trade offer with each other, such that a connectome is either shaped by geometry or non-geometric constraints
\end{itemize}

# Graphs
## Rich clubs
\begin{itemize}
    \item Measure the extent by which well connected nodes are connected to each other
    \item Networks of high rich-club coefficients have many connections between nodes of high degree
\end{itemize}
