Data
* Why do we have slightly different recoding times and how to go about this in sttc for example?
* nice i know now how to get the positions! are they always the same?
* So I will always have the same electrodes right? Across this dataset
* Expectations regarding our network builduing? Do we thing cortex vs. hippocampus different?
* I think I get it now but still how to we define the network? Need some STTC cutoff, right?

STTC
* Why STTC so often out of bound -1 to 1?
* Diagonal in STTC = 1, always?

Other
* General background reading on network neuroscience, I was thinking: Networks of the Brain, Olaf Sporns, worth it?
* If very difficult, other books
