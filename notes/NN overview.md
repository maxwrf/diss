# Network neuroscience
## Data collection
### Manual
* Fixing brain in preservative and slicing it up
### Recordings
* Recording from one electron while electronically stimulating others
### Chemical tracers
* Dyes that color in a neuron, where does the dye show up, following the connections
### Human connectome approach by Sporns, 2005
* Long range axons get wrapped in in myelin (waxy blanket), containing lots of water molecules
* Magnetic resonance imaging can detect the water, detect movement of water molecules
